# SMT_IV_Apocalypse_Save_Editor
Save editor for Shin Megami Tensei IV - Apocalypse

This is a save editor for Shin Megami Tensei IV - Apocalypse, made in Python 3. Tested in Windows, most probably works in Ubuntu as well. Compatibility with Python 2 not tested though, feel free to test it. Note that this save editor is only tested working for the save slot 1 in-game (sdds4game1.sav), other slots are not tested. The skill descriptions are also copied from the save editor for SMT IV, so some of the skills may have changed.
